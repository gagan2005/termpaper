\section{Introduction}


\section{Key Schedule}
We call the original key as master key and denote it as $mk$. It will be of 64/80/96 bit for  KLIEN 64/80/96. As a result of key scheduling algorthm 8/10/12  subkeys with length same as master key will be generated for KLIEN 64/80/96. Without LOG we will talk about key scheduling of KLEIN 64 \\

\begin{itemize}

\item The first subkey $sk_{0}$ is same as the master key \\
	$sk_{0}$=$mk$.Each of the subsequent $sk_{i+1}$ will be derived from $sk_{i}$ as follows - \\

\item Denote $sk_{i}$ as a tuple of bytes - (x0 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7) \\
Divide the tuple into two equal parts and call them a and b 

a - (x0 x1 x2 x3) \\
b - (x4 x5 x6 x7) \\

\item Now Perform one byte left circular shift to both a and b

a' = (x1 x2 x3 x0) \\
b' = (x7 x4 x5 x6) \\

\item Swap a' and b' i.e a'' = b' and b''=a' \\

\item Now let a'' = (y0 y1 y2 y3) \\
and b'' = (z0 z1 z2 z3) \\

We will Xor the round counter i with 3rd byte of a'' and pass 2nd and 3rd byte of b'' through the KLIEN S-BOX and then a''|b'' will become the next subkey \\
$s_{i+1}$ = (y0 y1 $ y2 \oplus R_i $ y3 z0 Sbox(z1) Sbox(z2) z4)\\
\end{itemize}
