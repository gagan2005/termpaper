\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

In this Presentation ,We have described the Design Specifications of KLEIN Cipher, Different attacks on KLEIN Cipher,Performance of KLEIN is Compared with other lightweight Ciphers.The goal is to explain how KLEIN is the practical and secure cipher for low-resource applications.Hardware efficiency of KLEIN from its simple structure with an involutive S-box. If we further modify rotate nibbles algorithm and Increase diffusion we can prevent the attacks.Further we can also compare DATA, TIME AND MEMORY complexities if skipjack, present, and klein as future work.
